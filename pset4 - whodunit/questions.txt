1.  What’s stdint.h?

- is a header file that defines integers with predefined width / size

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

- the capability to store numbers with different widths / sizes

- signed integers have the most significant bit as a flag which marks the value to be positive or negative
Basic signed integer type. Capable of containing at least the [−32,767, +32,767] thus, it is at least 16 bits in size.

- unsigned integers
Basic unsigned integer type. Contains at least the [0, 65535] range

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

- BYTE: 1
- DWORD: 4
- LONG: 4
- WORD: 2

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

- 42 4D

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

- bfSize is the bitmap image size ( biSize ) plus the bitmap headers
// bfSize = biSizeImage + sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) + sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER)
- biSize is the size of total rgbtriples plus the padding, if any


6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

- it means that the image is top-down device independent bitmap

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

- the field is biBitCount Specifies the number of bits per pixel (bpp). For uncompressed formats, this value is the average number of bits per pixel

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

- fopen returns null if it fails to open the file that the user inputed on the command line

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

- the third argument of fread is the number of the objects to be read, which in this case is 1

10. TODO

What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

- each scanline is a DWORD with 32 bits / 4 bytes, so it needs to be a multiple of 4
if not, padding is added to achieve a number that is a multiple of four

11. What does fseek do?

- it seeks / sets cursor to the second argument, which is the offset counting from the third argument
which is whence

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

- it specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position
